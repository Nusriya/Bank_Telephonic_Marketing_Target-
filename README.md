# Bank Telephonic Marketing Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains a Python project for predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on data from telephonic marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. The primary goal is to identify clients who are most likely to convert to term deposit subscriptions, which helps in optimizing marketing strategies and reducing costs associated with telemarketing.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project pertains to direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese bank. The marketing campaigns were executed via phone calls, and multiple contacts were often required to determine whether a client would subscribe to a term deposit (`'yes'` or `'no'`). The dataset includes various features related to the client's demographics, past contact history, and campaign information.

## Key Components

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes cleaning, feature selection, and transformation of the dataset to make it suitable for modeling.
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: A machine learning model used to predict the likelihood of a client subscribing to a term deposit.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessment of the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Graphs and plots to help understand the data and model performance.
