Context:
Term deposits are a key income source for banks.
A term deposit involves placing funds with a financial institution for a specified period, earning interest at an agreed rate. 
Banks use various strategies to promote term deposits, including email campaigns, advertisements, telemarketing, and digital marketing.
Despite the effectiveness of telemarketing campaigns, they are costly due to the need for large call centers. 
Therefore, it is important to identify customers who are most likely to convert before conducting these campaigns. 
The goal is to use data from direct marketing campaigns by a Portuguese bank to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.
